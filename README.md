This is an application that utilizes React wherein a user or guest can save card information for use on another site.
If the user decides to login, their card choices will animate below the form, if they sign out, their card information is saved for when they decide to come back.
If you're in a hurry, feel free to use this application as a guest user to simply validate a credit card (real or pretend), as this application will posses a degree of encryption.

I've gotten the inital layout set up. No CSS yet, but theres a boilerplate to work with along with a barebones validator until I research more avenues for verification. I'm looking into the possibility of needing to learn a database to continue/complete this project. If that's the case, I'm excited to learn how to parlay a new language or two into this to create a more complete experience for the user.
